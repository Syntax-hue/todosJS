# todosJS

This application is a TodoList which is made by using the following tech stack:
- Nodejs + express
- PostgreSQL (pg)
- React on the front end


Steps to run the application:
1. create a postgres database with name 'todoapp'
2. run the query from database.sql
3. Open terminal and run 'npm run server'
4. Open a new terminal and run 'npm run client'

Make sure you have node 8+ installed. For the database management I recommend using PgAdmin 3/4.
